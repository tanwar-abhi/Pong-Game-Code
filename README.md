# Pong_Game_Code
This repository contains code of a basic Pong-game which I worked on as a side projects of game development. 
This is the result of my personal interest and hobby in Game code development. Lua was used for the primary language.

main.lua file contains the functions which calls upon objects from the various classes such as Paddle.lua and Ball.lua etc..

To run the game use the command "love ." from the folder that contains all the files and subfiles.
